Practice web scraping using requests library and Beautiful Soup

Things I Learned:
* Beautiful Soup is a Python library that I'd never used before today. I'd heard of web scraping but never put it into practice.
* Using BS4 methods including .prettify(), .find(), .find_all()
* Ensuring syntax is correct, specifically having to add an underscore if you're searching for classes (syntax: class_='xyz')
* Using a for loop to loop through job listings: Not a new concept but I'm using it in a new context so figured I'd add here
* .strip() to remove unnecessary whitespace (never really had to use this before today)
* Uncovering 'AttributeErrors' - one of the featured job postings was a sponsored ad, so it had a different class name. It was fun to uncover why I was getting this error.
* Using lambda function - this is still pretty new to me, so it was exciting to use it outside of a course
